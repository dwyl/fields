# Fields

A collection of commonly used fields implemented as custom Ecto types
with the validation, sanitising and encryption/hashing. <br />
<!--
TODO: update intro copy once we ship better docs!
Ship your Phoenix App _much_ faster by using well-documented fields
with built-in validation, testing, sanitising and encryption.
See below for examples!

# _Why_? ü§∑

We found ourselves repeating code
for commonly used fields on each new Phoenix project/App.  
We wanted a _much_ easier/faster way of building apps
so we created a collection of pre-defined fields
with built-in validation, sanitising and security.

**`Fields`** makes defining Ecto Schemas much faster,
more precise and easier to render data input/edit
forms automatically based on the field type.

# _What_? üí≠

An Elixir package that helps you add popular custom types
to your Phoenix/Ecto schemas so you can build apps faster!


# _Who_? üë•

This module is for people building Elixir/Phoenix apps
who want to ship _simpler_ more maintainable code.

> **Note**: @dwyl we are firm believers that personal data
(_Personally Identifiable Information_ (PII)) should be encrypted "at rest"
i.e. all "user" data should be encrypted _before_ being stored in the database.

# _How_? ‚úÖ

> We've attempted to make **`Fields`** as easy to use as possible.
But if you get stuck using it, ask for
[help!](https://github.com/dwyl/fields/issues)


## 1. Add the hex package to `deps` üì¶

Add the `fields` package to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:fields, "~> 2.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Once added, run **`mix deps.get`** in your terminal to download.


## 2. Ensure you have the necessary environment variables üîë

In order to use Encryption and Hashing,
you will need to have environment variables
defined for `ENCRYPTION_KEYS` and `SECRET_KEY_BASE` respectively.

```yml
export ENCRYPTION_KEYS='nMdayQpR0aoasLaq1g94FLba+A+wB44JLko47sVQXMg=,L+ZVX8iheoqgqb22mUpATmMDsvVGtafoAeb0KN5uWf0='
export SECRET_KEY_BASE=GLH2S6EU0eZt+GSEmb5wEtonWO847hsQ9fck0APr4VgXEdp9EKfni2WO61z0DMOF
```

In our case we use a `.env` file to manage our environment variables.
See:
[github.com/dwyl/**learn-environment-variables**](https://git.io/JeMLg)


## 3. Apply the relevant field(s) to your schema üìù

Each field can be used in place of an Ecto type when defining your schema.

An example fo defining a "user" schema using **Fields**:

```
schema "users" do
  field :email, Fields.EmailEncrypted       # Validates email then encrypts
  field :address, Fields.AddressEncrypted   # Trims address string then encrypts
  field :postcode, Fields.PostcodeEncrypted # Validates postcode then encrypts
  field :password, Fields.Password          # Hash password with argon2

  timestamps()
end
```



Each field is defined as an
[Ecto type](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.Type.html),
with the relevant callbacks.
So when you call `Ecto.Changeset.cast/4`
in your schema's changeset function,
the field will be correctly validated.
For example, calling cast on the `:email` field
will ensure it is a valid format for an email address.

When you load one of the fields into your database,
the corresponding `dump/1` callback will be called,
ensuring it is inserted into the database in the correct format.
In the case of `Fields.EmailEncrypted`,
it will encrypt the email address
using a given encryption key
(set in your config file) before inserting it.

Likewise, when you load a field from the database,
the `load/1` callback will be called,
giving you the data in the format you need.
`Fields.EmailEncrypted` will be decrypted back to plaintext.

Each Field optionally defines an `input_type/0` function.
This will return an atom
representing the `Phoenix.HTML.Form` input type to use for the Field.
For example: `Fields.DescriptionPlaintextUnlimited.input_type` returns `:textarea`.

The fields `DescriptionPlaintextUnlimited`
and `HtmlBody` uses
[`html_sanitize_ex`](https://github.com/rrrene/html_sanitize_ex)
to remove scripts and help keep your project safe.
`HtmlBody` is able to display basic html elements
whilst `DescriptionPlaintextUnlimited` displays text.
Remember to use `raw` when rendering
the content of your `DescriptionPlaintextUnlimited`
and `HtmlBody` fields
so that symbols such as & (ampersand) and Html are rendered correctly.
E.g:
`<p><%= raw @product.description %></p>`

The currently existing fields are:

+ [`Address`](lib/address.ex) - an address for a physical location.
Validated and stored as a (`plaintext`) `String`.
+ [`AddressEncrypted`](lib/address_encrypted.ex) - an address for a customer
or user which should be stored encrypted for data protection.
+ [`DescriptionPlaintextUnlimited`](lib/description_plaintext_unlimited.ex)
+ [`Encrypted`](lib/encrypted.ex)
+ [`EmailPlaintext`](lib/email_plaintext.ex)
+ [`EmailHash`](lib/email_hash.ex)
+ [`EmailEncrypted`](lib/email_encrypted.ex)
+ [`Hash`](lib/hash.ex)
+ [`HtmlBody`](lib/html-body.ex)
+ [`Password`](lib/password.ex)
+ [`PhoneNumber`](lib/phone_number.ex)
+ [`PhoneNumberEncrypted`](lib/phone_number_encrypted.ex)
+ [`Postcode`](lib/postcode.ex)
+ [`PostcodeEncrypted`](lib/postcode_encrypted.ex)
+ [`Url`](lib/url.ex) - validate a URL and store as `plaintext` (_not encrypted_) `String`
+ [`UrlEncrypted`](lib/url_encrypted.ex) - validate a URL and store as AES _encrypted_ `Binary`

If there is a field that you need in your app
that is not already in the **`Fields`** package,
please open an issue so we can add it!
